**Balaji Fast Food Sales Analysis**

# **About Project**

The Balaji Fast Food Sales Analysis Project is designed to study the restaurantâ€™s transaction-level sales data and extract meaningful business insights. The dataset includes details such as order ID, date, item name, item type, item price, quantity, transaction amount, payment method, staff, time of sale, and profit.



The project applies data analytics and visualization techniques to understand:

*   How profit is distributed across different items.
*   Which item categories (snacks, beverages, meals) contribute more to revenue and profit.
*   The customer buying pattern (low-cost bulk items vs high-cost profitable items).
*   How transaction types (cash vs online) affect sales trends.
*   Daily and time-based sales performance (morning, afternoon, evening).
*   Which are the top-selling items in terms of volume.
*   Staff performance in handling transactions.
*   The key drivers of profit for the business.

By visualizing and analyzing these factors, the project provides actionable insights that can help Balaji Fast Food:


*   Optimize menu design (highlighting profit-generating items).
*   Improve marketing strategy (focus on peak sales periods).
*   Manage staff performance effectively.
*   Encourage digital payments for higher-value orders.
*   Enhance overall customer experience while increasing profitability.
